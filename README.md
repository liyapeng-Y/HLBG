Official PyTorch implementation of **“Navigating Hierarchy: Hyperbolic Learning on Brain Graphs for Disorder Diagnosis”**.

HLBG is designed for brain disorder diagnosis from functional brain networks. It models the natural hierarchy of brain graphs across **ROIs**, **functional communities**, and **whole-brain** levels by combining hyperbolic representation learning.

---

## Overview

Functional brain networks exhibit hierarchical organization: local ROI-level interactions support regional processing, community-level structures capture coordinated functional modules, and whole-brain patterns reflect global integration. Existing brain graph learning methods often underuse the relationships between ROIs, communities, and the full brain network.

To address this limitation, **Hyperbolic Learning on Brain Graphs (HLBG)** introduces a hierarchy-aware framework that:

- projects ROI-, community-, and whole-brain-level representations into Lorentzian hyperbolic space;
- imposes multi-level geometric entailment constraints to preserve brain-network hierarchy;
- uses a **Graph-aware Mamba (GaMamba)** module to capture long-range dependencies while retaining graph topology;
- learns discriminative representations for disorder diagnosis and biomarker discovery.

Experiments in the paper are conducted on **ABIDE-I** for Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis and **REST-MDD** for Major Depressive Disorder diagnosis.
